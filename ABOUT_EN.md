# Koe no Search - Fast File Search Application

## Description
Koe no Search is a modern file search application for computers. It combines powerful search algorithms with a user-friendly graphical interface, making it suitable for both regular users and professionals.

## Key Features
- Fast file search by name and extension

- File operations (copy, move, delete) with progress tracking
- Modern GUI with custom theme support
- Command-line interface for automation

## How It Works

### 1. Search Algorithm
The program uses a multi-threaded file system traversal algorithm with optimized pattern matching. Here's how it works:

1. **Thread Division and Management**
   - Worker pool configuration:
     * Based on runtime.NumCPU()
     * Configurable through SearchOptions
     * Default to CPU core count
   - Goroutine management:
     * Channel-based task distribution
     * Context-based cancellation
     * Clean shutdown handling

2. **Pattern Matching Engine**
   - Optimized pattern compilation:
     * Byte slice patterns for performance
     * Case folding when ignoreCase is true
     * Common pattern caching with sync.Map
   - Two-phase matching:
     * Quick extension check first
     * Full pattern matching second
   - Memory-efficient matching:
     * Reusable byte slices
     * Minimal allocations
     * Shared pattern cache

3. **Result Processing**
   - Buffered processing:
     * Channel-based result collection
     * Configurable buffer sizes
     * Memory-efficient storage
   - Virtual list for UI:
     * Chunked data storage
     * Lazy loading of visible items
     * Smooth scrolling support
   - Result filtering:
     * Size-based filtering
     * Date-based filtering
     * Path exclusion patterns

### 2. User Interface

1. **GUI Implementation**
   - Virtual list widget:
     * Efficient handling of large result sets
     * Visible item caching
     * Smooth scrolling performance
   - Custom theme:
     * Transparent buttons
     * Burgundy accent color
     * Background image support
   - Search panel:
     * Pattern and extension input
     * Directory selection
     * Search control buttons

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Real-time updates:
     * Files found counter
     * Error counter
     * Search duration
   - Status display:
     * Current operation
     * Processing speed
     * Remaining items

### 3. File Operations

1. **Operation Implementation**
   - File copying:
     * Buffered copy operations
     * Progress tracking
     * Error handling with retry
   - File moving:
     * Same-device optimization
     * Cross-device fallback
     * Atomic operations when possible
   - File deletion:
     * Permission verification
     * Confirmation dialogs
     * Error handling

2. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Pre-operation checks:
     * Path validation
     * Permission checks
     * Space verification
   - Error handling:
     * Type-specific errors
     * Recovery procedures
     * User notifications

### 4. Technical Implementation

1. **Core Components**
   - Search engine:
     * Concurrent directory walker
     * Pattern matcher
     * Result processor
   - Virtual list:
     * Chunk-based storage
     * Viewport management
     * Memory optimization
   - File operations:
     * Operation queue
     * Progress tracking
     * Error handling

2. **Performance Features**
   - Memory management:
     * Buffer pools (32KB default)
     * Result chunking
     * Cache management
   - I/O optimization:
     * Batch processing
     * Asynchronous operations
     * Platform-specific optimizations

3. **Platform Support**
   - Windows implementation:
     * Native file API usage
     * UNC path support
     * Explorer integration
   - Unix systems:
     * POSIX compliance
     * File permission handling
     * Case sensitivity support
